            <p class="par">Dear Santa Claus,</p>

            <p  class="par">My name is Welberthy Gustavo, and I am writing this letter to my Christmas Gifts. I need to say how I was this year and how I behaved, therefore I have not been as good as could have been.
                </p>

                This year I had a lot of work and was so tired, and I was not a good person, it was the month of the birthday of my friend and I was working a lot, and tired, then  I forgot about the party of my friend, and it was so bad, my friend was so sad about it, then when I remember about his birthday it was too late to do that, so in the other day I called my friend and said sorry, and I invited him to a park and he agreed and also he forgave me.   
                </p>
                <p  class="par">
                In addition, I talked about my work, so I was very busy, and it is stressful, hard, and makes me so tired and angry, soâ€¦, I was rude and cursed at some people from the call center when they called me to offer and to sell products and services, but I do not do it again, I feel sad about it, and next year I will remember to go to the party of my friend.
                </p>

                I would really like to receive a PlayStation 5, or a Macbook Pro, I know it is a little bit expensive but I promise to be a better person.
